Scikit-learn Basics Notebook and Dataset

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python. The accompanying Jupyter notebook covers fundamental concepts, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. A curated dataset is included for hands-on practice, enabling users to apply what they learn in real scenarios.

The notebook begins with an overview of the Scikit-learn library, explaining its key features and functionalities. It walks users through the process of loading and exploring the dataset, allowing for a better understanding of the data structure and its characteristics.

Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features are discussed in detail. Users will learn how to prepare data for machine learning models effectively.

Next, the notebook introduces various classification and regression algorithms available in Scikit-learn. Users will train models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, gaining insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are explained, providing users with the tools to assess model performance. The notebook encourages experimentation with different models and hyperparameters to understand how these changes affect outcomes.

To get started, users need to have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The notebook can be opened and run in any Jupyter environment, allowing for interactive learning.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to get hands-on experience with machine learning using Scikit-learn. By following the notebook, users will build a solid foundation in machine learning concepts and practices, paving the way for more advanced topics.
